 FILE READER: COUNT LINES, EXTRACT FIRST TWO LINES, WRITE TO NEW FILE

IN PLAIN ENGLISH:
  Think of a text file like a stack of index cards, one line per
  card. This script (1) counts how many cards are in the stack,
  (2) pulls out just the top two cards, and (3) writes copies of
  those two cards into a brand-new stack (a new file) \u2014 without
  ever touching or changing the original stack.
